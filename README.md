## Summary:

Simple PDF viewer made with PyQt6.  Scoured the Internet and for days and finally found a way to do it so I'm posting it here

## Requirements:

- PyQt6
- PyQt6-WebEngine

**Note: Tested on Python 3.10**

## Instructions:

Run the script like you would any other Python script.  Then click the "File" menu and choose a PDF to view.  You can also replace the [ENTER_PATH_HERE] in the script so it will automatically load a PDF.  This is useful for testing purposes.  For example, when you're modifying the script and need re-run it numerous times to make sure it's still working.

## Summary of Scripts:

| Script                   | Description                                                               |
