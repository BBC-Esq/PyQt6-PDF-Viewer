## Summary:

Simple PDF viewer made with PyQt6.  Scoured the Internet and for days and finally found a way to do it so I'm posting it here

## Requirements:

PyQt6

**Note: Tested on Python 3.10**

## Instructions:

1. NOTE: You can replace the [ENTER_PATH_HERE] within the script so it will automatically load a PDF.  This is useful for testing purposes when you want to modify the script and repeatedly test it without having to go to "file," "open," and select a PDF each time.
2. Otherwise, simply go to the "File" menu and select the PDF to load.

## Summary of Scripts:

| Script                   | Description                                                               |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| "draft_pdf_viewer.py"    | PDF viewer.                                                               |
